# ‚ú®üîê Safe Password Generator üîê‚ú®
*A cybersecurity project.*

## ‚ü° Description ‚ü°
Do you still use the same password for everything? Is it troublesome to always think of a new and safe password? <br>
*Well look no further because the answer to those questions are right here!*<br>
Choose from one of my 3 password generators based on how much control you want to have on it, and stay safer online. <br>

## ‚ü° Set-up ‚ü°
For none of this generators you need to install anything besides a place to run python code. All the necessary libraries don't need to be imported. 

## ‚ü° What it looks like ‚ü°
* Basic
```python
import string
import random

length = int(input("How many characters would you like your password to have?"))
char = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
password = "".join(random.choice(char) for i in range(length))
print("Your new safe password is: " + password)
```
* Advanced <br>

## ‚ü° Roadmap ‚ü°
I have just finished this 3 versions, and for future updates, I would like to work on: <br>
* A storage and encription system
* A graphic interface for better user experience. 

## ‚ü° Acknowledgment ‚ü°
Big thanks to *Ciberu* for the inspiration. 

## ‚ü° Goodbyes ‚ü°
Thank you so much for testing my generators. <br>
Any feedback on inprovements is very much welcome.
